.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBaria2c\fP [<OPTIONS>] [<URI>|<MAGNET>|<TORRENT_FILE>|<METALINK_FILE>] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
aria2 is a utility for downloading files. The supported protocols are
HTTP(S), FTP, SFTP, BitTorrent, and Metalink. aria2 can download a
file from multiple sources/protocols and tries to utilize your maximum
download bandwidth. It supports downloading a file from HTTP(S)/FTP
/SFTP and BitTorrent at the same time, while the data downloaded from
HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP is uploaded to the BitTorrent swarm. Using Metalink
chunk checksums, aria2 automatically validates chunks of data while
downloading a file.
.SH OPTIONS

.B \-i, \-\-input\-file=<FILE>
Downloads the URIs listed in \fBFILE\fP\&. You can specify multiple sources for a
single entity by putting multiple URIs on a single line separated by the
\fBTAB\fP character.
Additionally, options can be specified after each URI line. Option lines
must start with one or more white space characters (\fBSPACE\fP or \fBTAB\fP)
and must only contain one option per line.
Input files can use gzip compression.
When \fBFILE\fP is specified as \fB\-\fP, aria2 will read the input from \fBstdin\fP\&.
See the \fI\%Input File\fP subsection for details.
See also the \fI\%\-\-deferred\-input\fP option.
See also the \fI\%\-\-save\-session\fP option.

.B \-V, \-\-check\-integrity [true|false]
Check file integrity by validating piece hashes or a hash of entire
file.  This option has effect only in BitTorrent, Metalink downloads
with checksums or HTTP(S)/FTP downloads with
\fI\%\-\-checksum\fP option.  If
piece hashes are provided, this option can detect damaged portions
of a file and re\-download them.  If a hash of entire file is
provided, hash check is only done when file has been already
download. This is determined by file length. If hash check fails,
file is re\-downloaded from scratch.  If both piece hashes and a hash
of entire file are provided, only piece hashes are used. Default:

.B \-\-all\-proxy=<PROXY>
Use a proxy server for all protocols.  To override a previously
defined proxy, use "".  You also can override this setting and specify a
proxy server for a particular protocol using \fI\%\-\-http\-proxy\fP,
\fI\%\-\-https\-proxy\fP and \fI\%\-\-ftp\-proxy\fP options.  This affects all
downloads.
The format of PROXY is \fB[http://][USER:PASSWORD@]HOST[:PORT]\fP\&.
See also \fI\%ENVIRONMENT\fP section.

.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
If user and password are embedded in proxy URI and they are also
specified by \fI\-\-{http,https,ftp,all}\-proxy\-{user,passwd}\fP options,
those specified later override prior options. For example, if you specified
\fBhttp\-proxy\-user=myname\fP, \fBhttp\-proxy\-passwd=mypass\fP in aria2.conf and
you specified \fB\-\-http\-proxy="http://proxy"\fP on the command\-line, then
you\(aqd get HTTP proxy \fBhttp://proxy\fP with user \fBmyname\fP and password
\fBmypass\fP\&.
.sp
Another example: if you specified on the command\-line
\fB\-\-http\-proxy="http://user:pass@proxy" \-\-http\-proxy\-user="myname"
\-\-http\-proxy\-passwd="mypass"\fP, then you\(aqd get HTTP proxy
\fBhttp://proxy\fP with user \fBmyname\fP and password \fBmypass\fP\&.
.sp
One more example: if you specified in command\-line \fB\-\-http\-proxy\-user="myname"
\-\-http\-proxy\-passwd="mypass" \-\-http\-proxy="http://user:pass@proxy"\fP,
then you\(aqd get HTTP proxy \fBhttp://proxy\fP with user \fBuser\fP and password

Default: \fB60\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-dry\-run [true|false]
If \fBtrue\fP is given, aria2 just checks whether the remote file is
available and doesn\(aqt download data. This option has effect on
HTTP/FTP download.  BitTorrent downloads are canceled if \fBtrue\fP is
specified.  Default: \fBfalse\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-lowest\-speed\-limit=<SPEED>
Close connection if download speed is lower than or equal to this
value(bytes per sec).
\fB0\fP means aria2 does not have a lowest speed limit.
You can append \fBK\fP or \fBM\fP (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K).
This option does not affect BitTorrent downloads.

.B \-\-max\-file\-not\-found=<NUM>
If aria2 receives "file not found" status from the remote HTTP/FTP
servers NUM times without getting a single byte, then force the
download to fail. Specify \fB0\fP to disable this option. This options
is effective only when using HTTP/FTP servers.  The number of retry
attempt is counted toward \fI\%\-\-max\-tries\fP, so it should be
configured too.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-min\-split\-size=<SIZE>
aria2 does not split less than 2*SIZE byte range.  For example,
let\(aqs consider downloading 20MiB file. If SIZE is 10M, aria2 can
split file into 2 range [0\-10MiB) and [10MiB\-20MiB) and download it
using 2 sources(if \fI\%\-\-split\fP >= 2, of course).  If SIZE is 15M,
since 2*15M > 20MiB, aria2 does not split file and download it using
1 source.  You can append \fBK\fP or \fBM\fP (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K).
Possible Values: \fB1M\fP \-\fB1024M\fP Default: \fB20M\fP

.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
For network addresses with a subnet mask, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses work.
The current implementation does not resolve the host name in an URI to compare
network addresses specified in \fI\%\-\-no\-proxy\fP\&. So it is only effective
if URI has numeric IP addresses.

.B \-s, \-\-split=<N>
Download a file using N connections.  If more than N URIs are given,
first N URIs are used and remaining URIs are used for backup.  If
less than N URIs are given, those URIs are used more than once so
that N connections total are made simultaneously.  The number of
connections to the same host is restricted by the
\fI\%\-\-max\-connection\-per\-server\fP option.
See also the \fI\%\-\-min\-split\-size\fP option.
Default: \fB5\fP

\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Some Metalinks regulate the number of servers to connect.  aria2
strictly respects them.  This means that if Metalink defines the
\fBmaxconnections\fP attribute lower than N, then aria2 uses the
value of this lower value instead of N.
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-stream\-piece\-selector=<SELECTOR>
Specify piece selection algorithm used in HTTP/FTP download. Piece
means fixed length segment which is downloaded in parallel in
segmented download. If \fBdefault\fP is given, aria2 selects piece so
that it reduces the number of establishing connection. This is
reasonable default behavior because establishing connection is an
expensive operation.  If \fBinorder\fP is given, aria2 selects piece
which has minimum index. Index=0 means first of the file. This will
be useful to view movie while downloading it.
\fI\%\-\-enable\-http\-pipelining\fP option may
be useful to reduce re\-connection overhead.  Please note that aria2
honors
\fI\%\-\-min\-split\-size\fP option,
so it will be necessary to specify a reasonable value to
\fI\%\-\-min\-split\-size\fP option.
If \fBrandom\fP is given, aria2 selects piece randomly. Like
\fBinorder\fP, \fI\%\-\-min\-split\-size\fP option is honored.
If \fBgeom\fP is given, at the beginning aria2 selects piece which has
minimum index like \fBinorder\fP, but it exponentially increasingly
keeps space from previously selected piece. This will reduce the
number of establishing connection and at the same time it will
download the beginning part of the file first. This will be useful
to view movie while downloading it.
Default: \fBdefault\fP

Default: \fB60\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-uri\-selector=<SELECTOR>
Specify URI selection algorithm. The possible values are \fBinorder\fP,
\fBfeedback\fP and \fBadaptive\fP\&.  If \fBinorder\fP is given, URI is tried in
the order appeared in the URI list.  If \fBfeedback\fP is given, aria2
uses download speed observed in the previous downloads and choose
fastest server in the URI list. This also effectively skips dead
mirrors. The observed download speed is a part of performance
profile of servers mentioned in \fI\%\-\-server\-stat\-of\fP and
\fI\%\-\-server\-stat\-if\fP options.  If \fBadaptive\fP is given, selects one of
the best mirrors for the first and reserved connections.  For
supplementary ones, it returns mirrors which has not been tested
yet, and if each of them has already been tested, returns mirrors
which has to be tested again. Otherwise, it doesn\(aqt select anymore
mirrors. Like \fBfeedback\fP, it uses a performance profile of servers.

.SS Notes for Options
.SS Optional arguments
.sp
The options that have its argument surrounded by square brackets([])
take an optional argument. Usually omitting the argument is evaluated to \fBtrue\fP\&.
If you use short form of these options(such as \fB\-V\fP) and give
an argument, then the option name and its argument should be concatenated(e.g.
\fB\-Vfalse\fP). If any spaces are inserted between the option name and the argument,
the argument will be treated as URI and usually this is not what you expect.
.SS Units (K and M)
.sp
Some options takes \fBK\fP and \fBM\fP to conveniently represent 1024 and
1048576 respectively.  aria2 detects these characters in
case\-insensitive way. In other words, \fBk\fP and \fBm\fP can be used as
well as \fBK\fP and \fBM\fP respectively.
.SS URI, MAGNET, TORRENT_FILE, METALINK_FILE
.sp
You can specify multiple URIs in command\-line.  Unless you specify
\fI\%\-\-force\-sequential\fP option, all URIs must point to the same file or downloading will
fail.
.sp
You can specify arbitrary number of BitTorrent Magnet URI. Please note
that they are always treated as a separate download.  Both hex encoded
40 characters Info Hash and Base32 encoded 32 characters Info Hash are
supported. The multiple \fBtr\fP parameters are supported.  Because
BitTorrent Magnet URI is likely to contain \fB&\fP character, it is highly
recommended to always quote URI with single(\fB\(aq\fP) or double(\fB"\fP) quotation.
It is strongly recommended to enable DHT especially when \fBtr\fP
parameter is missing. See \fI\%http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0009.html\fP
for more details about BitTorrent Magnet URI.
.sp
You can also specify arbitrary number of torrent files and Metalink
documents stored on a local drive. Please note that they are always
treated as a separate download. Both Metalink4 and Metalink version
3.0 are supported.
.sp
You can specify both torrent file with \-T option and URIs. By doing
this, you can download a file from both torrent swarm and
HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP server at the same time, while the data from
HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP are uploaded to the torrent swarm.  For single file
torrents, URI can be a complete URI pointing to the resource or if URI
ends with /, name in torrent file in torrent is added. For multi\-file
torrents, name and path are added to form a URI for each file.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0

Make sure that URI is quoted with single(\fB\(aq\fP) or double(\fB"\fP) quotation if it

.SS Resuming Download
.sp
Usually, you can resume transfer by just issuing same command (aria2c
URI) if the previous transfer is made by aria2.
.sp
If the previous transfer is made by a browser or wget like sequential
download manager, then use \fI\%\-\-continue\fP option to continue the
transfer.
.SS Event Hook
.sp
aria2 provides options to specify arbitrary command after specific event
occurred. Currently following options are available:
\fI\%\-\-on\-bt\-download\-complete\fP,
\fI\%\-\-on\-download\-pause\fP,
\fI\%\-\-on\-download\-complete\fP\&.
\fI\%\-\-on\-download\-start\fP,
\fI\%\-\-on\-download\-error\fP,
\fI\%\-\-on\-download\-stop\fP\&.
.sp
aria2 passes 3 arguments to specified command when it is executed.
These arguments are: GID, the number of files and file path.  For
HTTP, FTP, and SFTP downloads, usually the number of files is 1.
BitTorrent download can contain multiple files.  If number of files is
more than one, file path is first one.  In other words, this is the
value of path key of first struct whose selected key is true in the
response of \fI\%aria2.getFiles()\fP RPC method.  If you want to get all
file paths, consider to use JSON\-RPC/XML\-RPC.  Please note that file
path may change during download in HTTP because of redirection or
Content\-Disposition header.
.sp
Let\(aqs see an example of how arguments are passed to command:

\fI\%\-\-no\-proxy\fP overrides this value.
.UNINDENT
.SH FILES
.SS aria2.conf
.sp
By default, aria2 checks whether the legacy path
\fB$HOME/.aria2/aria2.conf\fP is present, otherwise it parses
\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aria2/aria2.conf\fP as its configuration file.  You
can specify the path to configuration file using \fI\%\-\-conf\-path\fP
option.  If you don\(aqt want to use the configuration file, use
\fI\%\-\-no\-conf\fP option.
.sp
The configuration file is a text file and has 1 option per each
line. In each line, you can specify name\-value pair in the format:
\fBNAME=VALUE\fP, where name is the long command\-line option name without
\fB\-\-\fP prefix. You can use same syntax for the command\-line option. The
lines beginning \fB#\fP are treated as comments:
.INDENT 0.0

The confidential information such as user/password might be included
in the configuration file. It is recommended to change file mode
bits of the configuration file (e.g., \fBchmod 600 aria2.conf\fP), so
that other user cannot see the contents of the file.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The environment variables, such as \fB${HOME}\fP, are expanded by shell.
This means that those variables used in configuration file are not
expanded.  However, it is useful to \fB${HOME}\fP to refer user\(aqs home
directory in configuration file to specify file paths.  Therefore,
aria2 expands \fB${HOME}\fP found in the following option values to
user\(aqs home directory:

Note that this expansion occurs even if the above options are used in
the command\-line.  This means that expansion may occur 2 times: first,
shell and then aria2c.
.SS dht.dat
.sp
Unless the legacy file paths \fB$HOME/.aria2/dht.dat\fP and
\fB$HOME/.aria2/dht6.dat\fP are pointing to existing files, the routing
table of IPv4 DHT is saved to the path
\fB$XDG_CACHE_HOME/aria2/dht.dat\fP and the routing table of IPv6 DHT is
saved to the path \fB$XDG_CACHE_HOME/aria2/dht6.dat\fP\&.
.SS Netrc
.sp
Netrc support is enabled by default for HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP.  To disable
netrc support, specify \fI\%\-\-no\-netrc\fP option.  Your .netrc
file should have correct permissions(600).
.sp
If machine name starts \fB\&.\fP, aria2 performs domain\-match instead of
exact match. This is an extension of aria2. For example of domain
match, imagine the following .netrc entry:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
machine .example.org login myid password mypasswd
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBaria2.example.org\fP domain\-matches \fB\&.example.org\fP and uses \fBmyid\fP and
\fBmypasswd\fP\&.
.sp
Some domain\-match example follow: \fBexample.net\fP does not domain\-match
\fB\&.example.org\fP\&. \fBexample.org\fP does not domain\-match \fB\&.example.org\fP
because of preceding \fB\&.\fP\&. If you want to match \fBexample.org\fP, specify
\fBexample.org\fP\&.
.SS Control File
.sp
aria2 uses a control file to track the progress of a download.  A
control file is placed in the same directory as the downloading file
and its file name is the file name of downloading file with \fB\&.aria2\fP
appended.  For example, if you are downloading file.zip, then the
control file should be file.zip.aria2.  (There is a exception for this
naming convention.  If you are downloading a multi torrent, its
control file is the "top directory" name of the torrent with \fB\&.aria2\fP
appended.  The "top directory" name is a value of "name" key in "info"
directory in a torrent file.)
.sp
Usually a control file is deleted once download completed.  If aria2
decides that download cannot be resumed(for example, when downloading
a file from a HTTP server which doesn\(aqt support resume), a control
file is not created.
.sp
Normally if you lose a control file, you cannot resume download.  But
if you have a torrent or metalink with chunk checksums for the file,
you can resume the download without a control file by giving \-V option
to aria2c in command\-line.
.SS Input File
.sp
The input file can contain a list of URIs for aria2 to download.  You
can specify multiple URIs for a single entity: separate URIs on a
single line using the TAB character.
.sp
Each line is treated as if it is provided in command\-line argument.
Therefore they are affected by \fI\%\-\-force\-sequential\fP and \fI\%\-\-parameterized\-uri\fP options.
.sp
Since URIs in the input file are directly read by aria2, they must not
be quoted with single(\fB\(aq\fP) or double(\fB"\fP) quotation.
.sp
Lines starting with \fB#\fP are treated as comments and skipped.
.sp
Additionally, the following options can be specified after each line
of URIs. These optional lines must start with white space(s).

.SH RPC INTERFACE
.sp
aria2 provides JSON\-RPC over HTTP and XML\-RPC over HTTP interfaces that offer
basically the same functionality.  aria2 also provides JSON\-RPC
over WebSocket. JSON\-RPC over WebSocket uses the same method signatures
and response format as JSON\-RPC over HTTP, but additionally provides
server\-initiated notifications. See \fI\%JSON\-RPC over WebSocket\fP section for more
information.
.sp
The request path of the JSON\-RPC interface (for both over HTTP and over
WebSocket) is \fB/jsonrpc\fP\&.  The request path of the XML\-RPC interface is
\fB/rpc\fP\&.
.sp
The WebSocket URI for JSON\-RPC over WebSocket is
\fBws://HOST:PORT/jsonrpc\fP\&. If you enabled SSL/TLS encryption, use
\fBwss://HOST:PORT/jsonrpc\fP instead.
.sp
The implemented JSON\-RPC is based on JSON\-RPC 2.0
<\fI\%http://jsonrpc.org/specification\fP>, and
supports HTTP POST and GET (JSONP).  The WebSocket transport is
an aria2 extension.
.sp
The JSON\-RPC interface does not support notifications over HTTP, but the
RPC server will send notifications over WebSocket. It also does not
support floating point numbers. The character encoding must be UTF\-8.
.sp
When reading the following documentation for JSON\-RPC, interpret structs as JSON
objects.
.SS Terminology
.sp
GID
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The GID (or gid) is a key to manage each download. Each download will be
assigned a unique GID. The GID is stored as 64\-bit binary value in aria2.
For RPC access, it is represented as a hex string of 16 characters (e.g.,
\fB2089b05ecca3d829\fP). Normally, aria2 generates this GID for each
download, but the user can specify GIDs manually using the \fI\%\-\-gid\fP option. When querying downloads by GID, you can specify only the
prefix of a GID as long as it is unique among others.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS RPC authorization secret token
.sp
As of 1.18.4, in addition to HTTP basic authorization, aria2 provides
RPC method\-level authorization. In a future release, HTTP basic
authorization will be removed and RPC method\-level authorization will
become mandatory.
.sp
To use RPC method\-level authorization, the user has to specify an RPC secret
authorization token using the \fI\%\-\-rpc\-secret\fP option. For each RPC
method call, the caller has to include the token prefixed with
\fBtoken:\fP\&. Even when the \fI\%\-\-rpc\-secret\fP option is not used, if the
first parameter in the RPC method is a string and starts with \fBtoken:\fP, it
will removed from the parameter list before the request is being processed.
.sp
For example, if the RPC secret authorization token is \fB$$secret$$\fP,
calling \fIaria2.addUri\fP RPC method would have to look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aria2.addUri("token:$$secret$$", ["http://example.org/file"])
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fIsystem.multicall\fP RPC method is treated specially. Since the XML\-RPC
specification only allows a single array as a parameter for this method, we
don\(aqt specify the token in the call. Instead, each nested method call has
to provide the token as the first parameter as described above.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The secret token validation in aria2 is designed to take at least a certain
amount of time to mitigate brute\-force/dictionary attacks against the RPC
interface. Therefore it is recommended to prefer Batch or \fIsystem.multicall\fP
requests when appropriate.
.sp
\fIsystem.listMethods\fP and \fIsystem.listNotifications\fP can be executed without token. Since they just
return available methods/notifications, they do not alter anything, they\(aqre safe without secret token.

.TP
.B aria2.addUri([secret], uris[, options[, position]])
This method adds a new download. \fIuris\fP is an array of
HTTP/FTP/SFTP/BitTorrent URIs (strings) pointing to the same
resource.  If you mix URIs pointing to different resources, then the
download may fail or be corrupted without aria2 complaining.  When
adding BitTorrent Magnet URIs, \fIuris\fP must have only one element and
it should be BitTorrent Magnet URI.  \fIoptions\fP is a struct and its
members are pairs of option name and value.  See \fI\%Options\fP
below for more details.  If \fIposition\fP is given, it must be an
integer starting from 0. The new download will be inserted at
\fIposition\fP in the waiting queue. If \fIposition\fP is omitted or
\fIposition\fP is larger than the current size of the queue, the new
download is appended to the end of the queue.  This method returns
the GID of the newly registered download.

This method adds a BitTorrent download by uploading a ".torrent" file.
If you want to add a BitTorrent Magnet URI, use the \fI\%aria2.addUri()\fP
method instead.  \fItorrent\fP must be a base64\-encoded string containing the
contents of the ".torrent" file.
\fIuris\fP is an array of URIs (string). \fIuris\fP is used for
Web\-seeding.  For single file torrents, the URI can be a complete URI
pointing to the resource; if URI ends with /, name in torrent file
is added. For multi\-file torrents, name and path in torrent are
added to form a URI for each file.
\fIoptions\fP is a struct and its members are pairs of option name and value.
See \fI\%Options\fP below for more details.
If \fIposition\fP is given, it must be an integer starting from 0. The new
download will be inserted at \fIposition\fP in the waiting queue. If
\fIposition\fP is omitted or \fIposition\fP is larger than the current size of the
queue, the new download is appended to the end of the queue.
This method returns the GID of the newly registered download.
If \fI\%\-\-rpc\-save\-upload\-metadata\fP is \fBtrue\fP, the
uploaded data is saved as a file named as the hex string of SHA\-1 hash of

For the \fIkeys\fP parameter, please refer to the \fI\%aria2.tellStatus()\fP method.

If \fIoffset\fP is a positive integer, this method returns downloads in the
range of [\fIoffset\fP, \fIoffset\fP + \fInum\fP).
.sp
\fIoffset\fP can be a negative integer. \fIoffset\fP == \-1 points last
download in the waiting queue and \fIoffset\fP == \-2 points the download

in reversed order then.
.sp
For example, imagine three downloads "A","B" and "C" are waiting
in this order. \fBaria2.tellWaiting(0, 1)\fP returns
\fB["A"]\fP\&. \fBaria2.tellWaiting(1, 2)\fP returns \fB["B", "C"]\fP\&.
\fBaria2.tellWaiting(\-1, 2)\fP returns \fB["C", "B"]\fP\&.

.B aria2.changePosition([secret], gid, pos, how)
This method changes the position of the download denoted by

\fIpos\fP is an integer.
\fIhow\fP is a string. If \fIhow\fP is \fBPOS_SET\fP, it moves the download to a
position relative to the beginning of the queue.  If \fIhow\fP is \fBPOS_CUR\fP, it
moves the download to a position relative to the current position. If \fIhow\fP is
\fBPOS_END\fP, it moves the download to a position relative to the end of the
queue. If the destination position is less than 0 or beyond the end of
the queue, it moves the download to the beginning or the end of the
queue respectively. The response is an integer denoting the resulting
position.
.sp
For example, if GID#2089b05ecca3d829 is currently in position 3,
\fBaria2.changePosition(\(aq2089b05ecca3d829\(aq, \-1, \(aqPOS_CUR\(aq)\fP will
change its position to 2. Additionally
\fBaria2.changePosition(\(aq2089b05ecca3d829\(aq, 0, \(aqPOS_SET\(aq)\fP will
change its position to 0 (the beginning of the queue).

.B aria2.changeUri([secret], gid, fileIndex, delUris, addUris[, position])
This method removes the URIs in \fIdelUris\fP from and appends the URIs in
\fIaddUris\fP to download denoted by \fIgid\fP\&. \fIdelUris\fP and \fIaddUris\fP are
lists of strings. A download can contain multiple files and URIs are
attached to each file.  \fIfileIndex\fP is used to select which file to
remove/attach given URIs. \fIfileIndex\fP is 1\-based. \fIposition\fP is used
to specify where URIs are inserted in the existing waiting URI
list. \fIposition\fP is 0\-based. When \fIposition\fP is omitted, URIs are
appended to the back of the list.  This method first executes the removal
and then the addition. \fIposition\fP is the position after URIs are removed,
not the position when this method is called.  When removing an URI, if
the same URIs exist in download, only one of them is removed for each URI
in \fIdelUris\fP\&. In other words, if there are three URIs
\fBhttp://example.org/aria2\fP and you want remove them all, you have to
specify (at least) 3 \fBhttp://example.org/aria2\fP in \fIdelUris\fP\&.  This
method returns a list which contains two integers. The first integer is
the number of URIs deleted. The second integer is the number of URIs
added.
.sp
The following examples add the URI \fBhttp://example.org/file\fP to the
file whose index is \fB1\fP and belongs to the download

.SS Error Handling
.sp
Over JSON\-RPC, aria2 returns a JSON object which contains an error code in
\fBcode\fP and the error message in \fBmessage\fP\&.
.sp
Over XML\-RPC, aria2 returns \fBfaultCode=1\fP and the error message in
\fBfaultString\fP\&.
.SS Options
.sp
The same options as for \fI\%\-\-input\-file\fP are available. See the
\fI\%Input File\fP subsection for a complete list of options.
.sp
In the option struct, the name element is the option name (without the preceding
\fB\-\-\fP) and the value element is the argument as a string.

.SS JSON\-RPC using HTTP GET
.sp
The JSON\-RPC interface also supports requests via HTTP GET.
The encoding scheme in GET parameters is based on JSON\-RPC over HTTP Specification [2008\-1\-15(RC1)].
The encoding of GET parameters are follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/jsonrpc?method=METHOD_NAME&id=ID&params=BASE64_ENCODED_PARAMS
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBmethod\fP and \fBid\fP are always treated as JSON string and their
encoding must be UTF\-8.
.sp
For example, The encoded string of
\fBaria2.tellStatus(\(aq2089b05ecca3d829\(aq)\fP with \fBid=\(aqfoo\(aq\fP looks like
this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

/jsonrpc?method=aria2.tellStatus&id=foo&params=WyIyMDg5YjA1ZWNjYTNkODI5Il0%3D
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBparams\fP parameter is Base64\-encoded JSON array which usually
appears in \fBparams\fP attribute in JSON\-RPC request object.  In the
above example, the params is \fB["2089b05ecca3d829"]\fP, therefore:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
["2089b05ecca3d829"] \-\-(Base64)\-\-> WyIyMDg5YjA1ZWNjYTNkODI5Il0=

.SS JSON\-RPC over WebSocket
.sp
JSON\-RPC over WebSocket uses same method signatures and response
format as JSON\-RPC over HTTP. The supported WebSocket version is 13
which is detailed in \fI\%RFC 6455\fP\&.
.sp
To send a RPC request to the RPC server, send a serialized JSON string
in a Text frame. The response from the RPC server is delivered also in
a Text frame.
.SS Notifications
.sp
The RPC server might send notifications to the client. Notifications is
unidirectional, therefore the client which receives the notification must not
respond to it. The method signature of a notification is much like a normal
method request but lacks the id key. The value of the params key is the data
which this notification carries. The format of the value varies depending on the
notification method. Following notification methods are defined.
.INDENT 0.0
